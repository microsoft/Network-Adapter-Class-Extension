We welcome bug reports or feature suggestions.
You can file theme here on our GitHub repository's issue tracker, or email us at NetAdapter@microsoft.com.

NetAdapterCx.sys is under heavy development, so its implementation is changing quite a bit.
Currently, we do that development internally at Microsoft, so you won't see the in-progress changes here on GitHub.
The code here is a snapshot of the last shipping version of NetAdapterCx.
That means we cannot take pull requests through GitHub.
If you would like to collaborate with us on the code, please contact us first.
